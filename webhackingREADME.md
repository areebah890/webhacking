## ðŸ“Œ Room Summary

In the **Web Hacking Room**, I got hands-on experience with real-world web application security. I started by exploring the site, discovering hidden directories and endpoints, and analyzing how the application handled input. Along the way, I encountered common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, local file inclusion, insecure file uploads, and authentication logic flaws. I also practiced moving from an initial foothold to higher privileges on the system.

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned

Through this room, I learned how to:

- Perform web reconnaissance and enumeration using tools like `gobuster`, `ffuf`, and Burp Suite.
- Identify and exploit common web vulnerabilities in a safe, controlled environment.
- Capture sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, and flags.
- Establish a shell and escalate privileges to fully compromise the target machine.
- Understand defensive measures, like input validation, secure file upload handling, and least-privilege principles, so I know how to protect applications from attackers.

Completing this room gave me both **offensive hacking skills** and a deeper **understanding of how to defend web applications**, which is invaluable for anyone interested in penetration testing or cybersecurity.
