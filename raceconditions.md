# ‚è± Race Conditions ‚Äì Task Breakdown

## üìù Room Overview
The **Race Conditions** room taught me how concurrency issues in web applications can be exploited, how to detect them, and how to defend against them. I learned both the theory and practical techniques for testing race conditions safely.

## üìå Tasks & Learnings

### 1. Understanding Race Conditions
- **Task:** Learn the concept of race conditions and why they occur.  
- **Learning:** I learned that race conditions happen when multiple processes access and modify the same resource simultaneously, and the system does not properly synchronize these actions. This can lead to inconsistent or unintended results.

---

### 2. Identifying Potential Targets
- **Task:** Identify endpoints or actions vulnerable to race conditions.  
- **Learning:** I looked for operations that:  
  - Update critical resources (like inventory, balances, or counters)  
  - Do not implement locking or atomic transactions  
  - Could be triggered multiple times in parallel  
  I understood that these are likely candidates for exploitation.

---

### 3. Exploiting a Race Condition
- **Task:** Attempt to trigger a race condition in a controlled lab environment.  
- **Learning:** Using multiple rapid requests or concurrent scripts, I manipulated actions to achieve an unexpected result‚Äîsuch as duplicating a purchase or bypassing a restriction.  
- **Takeaway:** Timing is crucial; precise concurrency can make the difference between success and failure.

---

### 4. Automating Race Condition Testing
- **Task:** Use scripts or tools to reproduce race conditions reliably.  
- **Learning:** I learned that manual testing often fails due to timing issues. Automating requests allows consistent and repeatable results, demonstrating the vulnerability clearly.

---

### 5. Observing and Documenting Effects
- **Task:** Record the behavior caused by the race condition.  
- **Learning:** I documented the inconsistent application state (e.g., inventory count, duplicated transaction). Clear documentation is essential for reporting vulnerabilities responsibly.

---

### 6. Defensive Measures
- **Task:** Learn how to mitigate race conditions.  
- **Learning:** Effective defenses include:  
  - Implementing **locking mechanisms** or atomic transactions  
  - Serializing access to critical resources  
  - Rate-limiting operations that affect shared resources  
  - Logging unusual simultaneous actions for monitoring

---

## üéØ Key Takeaways
- Race conditions are **logic and timing vulnerabilities**, not just input-based.  
- Detecting and exploiting them requires careful observation and sometimes automation.  
- Proper synchronization, atomic operations, and rate-limiting are critical defenses.  
- Documenting both the exploit and mitigation strategies demonstrates professionalism and understanding.
